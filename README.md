# RAxMLGrove

The assessment of novel phylogenetic models and inference methods is routinely being conducted via experiments on simulated as well as empirical data. When generating synthetic data it is often unclear how to 
set simulation parameters for the models and generate tree shapes that appropriately reflect empirical model parameter distributions and tree shapes.
As a solution, we present and make available a new database 
called 'RAxML Grove' currently comprising more than 58,000 inferred trees and respective model parameter estimates from fully anonymized empirical datasets that were analyzed using [RAxML](https://github.com/stamatak/standard-RAxML) and [RAxML-NG](https://github.com/amkozlov/raxml-ng) on two respective web-servers (https://raxml-ng.vital-it.ch and https://www.phylo.org/index.php).

Example scripts using this database can be found [here](https://github.com/angtft/RAxMLGroveScripts).
